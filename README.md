# Network-Traffic-Anomaly-Detector

I captured real network using Wireshark to extract packet data. I used Python with NumPy to model normal packet behavior. 
I used Z-score anomaly detection to flag packets that significantly deviated from baseline traffic patterns.

This model is quite simple and does not work in real time.
